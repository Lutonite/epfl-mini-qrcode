     * and the opposite side of the QR Code, any uneven spacing being accommodated between the timing pattern and
     * the first alignment pattern on the right side of the timing pattern.
     * We will also need the intervals to be even, so that they fit with the timing patterns.

         * This calculation computes the interpolation of the two end points which we know to get the amount of steps
         * between all of the coordinates for the alignment patterns.
         *
         * We need three different things:
         *      - The last position of the QR code which needs to be exactly opposite to the QR code placed on the
         *        timing pattern
         *      - The second to last position in order to find the step between each alignment pattern. This is done
         *        with the following calculation:
         *              x_{n-1} = (x_0 + x_n * (n - 2)) / (n - 1)
         *              where x_n is the nth coordinate and n the amount of coordinates needed
         *        This calculation allows us to find the second to last position. Since we are using integer divisions,
         *        in some rare cases (where the result above has a decimal part above 0.5) the result will not be
         *        rounded properly. This is why we add half of the division up front. The calculation then becomes:
         *              x_{n-1} = (x_0 + x_n * (n - 2) + ((n - 1) / 2)) / (n - 1)
         *        Note that this second calculation only works if we use integer divisions.
         *        We then use a bitwise operation to round down to the closest even number to ensure our alignment
         *        patterns will be synced with the timing patterns. As specified, the difference this will create will
         *        only affect the distance between the timing pattern and the first alignment pattern on its right side.
         *      - Once we have this second to last position, we can safely calculate the step between the patterns and
         *        then calculate the position at which the second module in the line should go. This has to be defined
         *        from the last pattern position to ensure that any rounding loss from the operation mentioned
         *        herein-above is compensated.
         *
         *        Then it is a simple matter of adding the coordinates to the final array.
